 Realtor website
This code was developed by me ad my partner Jason Gill

We created a realtor website that has 3 users, a buyer, seller, and manager. This website allows a seller to post job listings, it allows a buyer to view all available listings and it allows a manager to add new users.

For the Front end we used HTML&CSS, the back end was done in Java and lastly we used my SQL for the databses.
